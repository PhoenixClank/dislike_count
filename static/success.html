		<h1>Success!</h1>
		<p>Your channel has been added to my program's watchlist.</p>
		<p>Your videos' dislike counts will appear in their descriptions, starting tomorrow (at the latest), and update themselves automatically once per day. There's nothing more you need to do.</p>
		<p>Of course you can still edit your videos' descriptions yourself, it won't interfere with my program. If you accidentally remove the dislike count, it'll reappear automatically on the next day.</p>
		<p>If you don't want my program to have access to your channel anymore, visit <a href="https://myaccount.google.com/permissions"><code>myaccount.google.com/permissions</code></a> and remove it from there.</p>
